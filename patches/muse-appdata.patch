+      <description>
+        <p>The third pre-release for 3.1.0.</p>
+        <ul>
+          <li>Customizable size of icons and custom tool cursors (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Replaced one-letter column headers by icons in track header (kybos)</li>
+          <li>German translation updated (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Build issues:
+          <ul>
+            <li>Dependency problems: Moved several files. All source together with ui files now. (Tim)</li>
+            <li>Remove all dead obsolete trackinfo 'alt' button code.</li>
+            <li>Fix some compile warnings with LV2 worker functions, some others. (Tim)</li>
+            <li>Moved appearance and confmport cpp/h files from /muse
+            to muse/components. Trying to solve some dependency
+            problems...</li>
+          </ul>
+          </li>
+          <li>FIXED: Mixer strips missing if loading an older song saved before 20.10.2019</li>
+          <li>FIXED: Duplicate strips found in songs saved before 20.10.2019</li>
+          <li>FIXED: Long-time mixer problem with restoring size</li>
+          <li>Remove some more "old vs. new" drum track stuff, change
+          some text etc. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Added option for opening MDI subwindows maximized (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Fix gross misnomer throughout, should be "timebase
+          master, not "transport master"</li>
+          <li>Fix EffectRack::songChanged() crash when reloading
+          songs: Check track still exists. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Update start play position when making a seek. Rewind to
+          Start behaves more logical then, imho (rj)</li>
+          <li>Fixed bug #719 downmix to existing file appends to the old file (rj)</li>
+          <li>Transport master fixes: New button on transport. Fix
+          connect at startup etc. (Tim) Seems there is no way to ask
+          Jack if are we transport master (without setting it).  So
+          new code in our Jack driver - and a 1Hz watchdog - monitor
+          for changes to master status.  Care was taken to not disturb
+          who else may be master. Click flashing button to force.
+          Tested the new button OK with three instances of MusE
+          competing for transport master.</li>
+          <li>Added File->New from template... menu entry. File->New
+          loads default template (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Fixed inconsistent UI texts where appropriate: (kybos)
+            <ul>
+              <li>Title-style for menu texts and window titles</li>
+              <li>Sentence-style for all other UI texts</li>
+              <li>Three dots (...) for menu entries triggering a dialog (like Save As...)</li>
+            </ul>
+          </li>
+          <li>Fixed inconsistent tooltip font size (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Vector replacements for many pixmap icons (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Fixed bug #720 arm follows track did bad things while recording (rj)</li>
+          <li>Eliminated all but one tr("Empty") string usage in
+          plugins/pipeline/rack. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Snooper: Provide flashColor property. Changed it in
+          Ardour and Dark qss themes.</li>
+          <li>Added a specialization of QMdiArea to work around
+          problems with PgUp and PgDown shortcuts as it was found
+          through Snooper tool that this is the widget that was
+          stealing the keypresses.</li>
+          <li>Another keypress fix in pcanvas.cpp to allow Return to be captured</li>
+          <li>Fixed a crash in drumlist when using a drummap and
+          opening without the port having been properly initialized
+          (in this case the synth plugin was missing). The dm->port
+          had an extreme value, now the range is checked. (rj)</li>
+          <li>Fix #697: On HiDPI displays, plugin native UI windows
+          are automatically scaled by Qt, but most of the native
+          plugin UIs are not scalable or apply their own
+          scaling. There is now a global setting for reverting the Qt
+          window scaling. It can be overridden for each soft synth
+          track by a local setting in the Quirks toolbar. (kybos)</li>
+          <li>Fix # 708: Surge-vst crashes. It called our
+          pluginHostCallback() immediately from instantiate() before
+          we stored the pointer. Added VstNativeSynth::openPlugin()
+          (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Fixed the DidYouKnow menu alternative so it shows the
+          dialog even if the checkbox for not displaying it is
+          checked. (rj)</li>
+          <li>Added a few more lines to the DidYouKnow.txt database</li>
+          <li>Snooper improvements, fix crashes, fix 'parented top
+          level' not working right. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Unfortunately had to revoke the 'easy fix' below for
+          getting more shortcuts to work there were side effects...
+          The search goes on for the 'real' solution (rj)</li>
+          <li>Snooper improvements. Moved to Help menu. Live realtime
+          monitoring of events. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>New - Introducing the Snooper (object tree) for coders
+          and stylesheet authors: (Tim) Click new Snooper button in
+          Appearance to start. Then click on anything anywhere</li>
+          <li> More keyboard shortcuts
+            <ul>
+              <li>First of, I found out that several shortcuts never end
+              up in the dispatcher since they (rj) were tested against
+              the "accepted" property. Seems this is not reliable nor
+              needed, it affected atleast PgUp, PgDn and Return.</li>
+              <li>Arm currently selected track can now be bound: Default
+              Ctrl+Return</li>
+              <li>Goto end of song can be bound: Shift+W</li>
+            </ul>
+          </li>
+          <li>New solution to making bar lines more visible. Basically
+          removed more hardcoded colors and made them configurable in
+          the appearance dialog (rj)</li>
+          <li>Fixed escape-key shortcut for closing a few more dialogs/editors:
+          master track list/graphical, instrument editor (rj)</li>
+          <li>Advanced router stylesheet support: New property
+          'RouteTreeWidget::categoryColor'. (Tim) Also specific
+          instance IDs Router_input_tree and Router_output_tree, if
+          desired.</li>
+          <li>Add command line option -C "Do not re-create plugin
+          cache."  (Tim) Avoids (looong) repeated re-creations in some
+          cases. Helps devs avoid after rebuilds.</li>
+          <li>Soundfont *.sf3 files: Small tweak allows our MESS
+          fluidsynth to load them. (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Add dedicated new 'mute parts' svg icon, for 17.11 (Tim)</li>
+          <li>Bug 681: Fix multichannel track feeding aux track, no
+          audio. In AudioTrack::copyData().</li>
+          <li>Fixed metronome selection of wave files, the selection
+          in the ui did not actually do anything. (rj)</li>
+          <li>Introduce new scalable icons and cursors for edit tools
+          (kybos) Improved cursor interaction in piano roll/drum
+          editor (event canvas vs. control canvas), cursor shape shows
+          when cursor has no function in given area Consistent cursor
+          shape display in all editors affected (midi, part, score,
+          master, wave) Correct cursor size on HiDPI screens (fixes
+          issue #637)</li>
+          <li>LV2: Fix sequencing/syncing plugins (Helm, LV2
+          metronome, NoiseMak3r...) (Tim) Fixed TimePosition
+          usage. Add quirks class for different plugin behaviour
+          observed.</li>
+          <li>Generic plugin UI: Added 'Quirks' buttons to toolbar:
+          "fixed speed" (fixes NoiseMak3r modulator stuck in small
+          loop in stop mode for ex.), "transport affects latency"
+          (self-correcting LV2 Example Metronome for ex.), and
+          "override reported latency" (for plugins with broken or
+          inaccurate latency reporting).</li>
+        </ul>
